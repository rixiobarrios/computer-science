# Computer Science

The Computer Science portion of the Software Engineering Immersive curriculum
equips students with foundational CS knowledge to make them more well-rounded
engineers and prepare them for questions that often arise in job interviews.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this unit, developers will be able to:

- Solving algorithmic challenges that are commonly presented in technical
  interviews.
- Analyzing the computational complexity of algorithms and data structures using
  Big O notation.
- Implementing common data structures encountered in technical interview
  questions.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements.

Each subdirectory in this repository contains an exercise for each topic covered
in the Computer Science curriculum. Complete each exercise, committing as you
go. When you finish, make a pull request on this repository.

Unless otherwise specified on the calendar or by an instructor, homework is due
the next morning by 9:00am.

## Lesson Format

The Computer Science lessons utilizes a blended learning approach.

Blended learning is just a fancy way of describing a course that combines live,
face-to-face instruction with asynchronous online lessons. Together, the
face-to-face and online portions make up one cohesive lesson on a given topic.

- The lesson portion of each topic will be first presented on
  [myGA](https://my.generalassemb.ly) (Where you did your prework!)
- The in-class portion of each topic will include a brief review of the topic,
  lead by an instructor, and an exercise that you will complete on your own.
