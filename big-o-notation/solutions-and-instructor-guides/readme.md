# Big O Notation Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on [Big O Notation](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/511?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f) before attempting the in-class exercise.

There's no coding challenge for this lesson. Rather, students are asked to analyze algorithms and determine their runtime class. The Exercises folder has the question prompts, and this folder has the answers.

> **Note**: The Big O myGA lesson **does not link to CodePen or this in-class exercise**, so students won't be exposed to it before class.

## Tiering
Big O Notation is a **Tier 1** lesson. Big O is a foundational concept referenced many times throughout the Computer Science curriculum. It's also a popular interview question topic. By the end of this lesson, make sure that students understand what Big O is, the differences between the classes, and how to analyze algorithms.

## Teaching Tips
* The in-class time for Big O can look more like a discussion or refresher of the myGA module than a lab. There's no coding component, so students should be working together in pairs/groups to identify each algorithm's runtime.
* If students aren't able to determine each algorithm's complexity on their own, be sure to review and explain each algorithm by the end of class.
