# Search Algorithms Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on [Search Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/633?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f) before attempting the in-class exercises.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note
The myGA module contains links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/aMbWQj). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.**

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Search Algorithms is a **Tier 1** lesson. Binary search is widely used, so students should understand the concept and attempt to implement the algorithm.

## Differentiations
* The exercise has two parts: writing binary search iteratively and then recursively. Focus students on writing the algorithm iteratively first before trying to write it recursively.
