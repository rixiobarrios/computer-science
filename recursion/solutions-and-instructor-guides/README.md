# Recursion Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on [Recursion](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/773?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f) before attempting the in-class exercise.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note
The myGA module contains links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/oVNWjd). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.**

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Recursion is a **Tier 1 lesson.** Recursion is a popular interview question topic, and many of the algorithms that come later in CS use it (e.g., merge sort and binary search). Make sure that students understand how to write a recursive function and understand the concept.

## Teaching Tips
* The Recursion exercise asks students to write five functions recursively. If students are struggling, it's perfectly fine for them to only complete the first two or three functions.
* [floodIt](https://git.generalassemb.ly/software-engineering-immersive/SEI-Course-Materials/tree/master/6_computer-science-materials/algorithms/recursion/exercises/floodIt-challenge) is an optional advanced challenge for students who complete the initial exercises.
