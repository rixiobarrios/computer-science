# Linked Lists Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on Linked Lists before attempting the in-class exercises.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder also contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note
The myGA module contains links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/MxWQVm). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.**

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Linked Lists is a **Tier 1** lesson. It's one of the few Data Structures lessons that is Tier 1, so be sure to spend time with it. Linked lists are a _very_ common interview topic, and we reference them in later Data Structures lessons, so it's important that students understand how to implement and work with them.
