# Intro to Sorting Algorithms Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on [Intro to Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/818?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f) before attempting the in-class exercises.

> **Note**: The Intro to Sorting Algorithms myGA lesson **does not link to CodePen or this in-class exercise**, so students won't be exposed to it before class.

## Tiering
Intro to Sorting Algorithms is a **Tier 1** lesson in that it introduces basic concepts about all sorting algorithms that are referenced in future lessons. It's not particularly complicated, but it's important for students to understand these concepts before going much further into sorting algorithms and their implementations.

## Teaching Tips
* The "My First Sort" exercise is meant to be fun and easy and illustrate basic sorting concepts (stability, space complexity, and time complexity). If you're low on time and need to skip the exercise, that's fine. You can also use this hour to revisit recursion or get started on the bubble sort and insertion sort implementations. (But we promise, this exercise is fun!)
* You should make sure you have a bunch of decks of playing cards for the activity — one for every two students. If you don't have that many, you can give each pair 10–15 cards to use in the exercise.
* When every group has finished the exercise, be sure to lead a debriefing conversation using the questions in the exercises README. (Answers to those questions are in the solutions file in this folder.)
