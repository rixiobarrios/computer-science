# Basic Sorts Instructor Guide

Students (and instructors!) should complete the myGA module on [Basic Sorting Algorithms](https://my.generalassemb.ly/activities/778?from=dashboard&assignmentUuid=4cdfc361-13c8-48ec-9e6f-8ac374151e7f) before attempting the in-class exercises.

The Exercises folder contains the starter code and test scripts for students to use. This folder contains solution code for the exercises (not to be shared with students).

### Important Note
The myGA module contains links to starter code in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/GAmarketing/pen/xMeqaN). **This starter code is the exact same as the starter code in the in-class exercises in this folder.** 

The CodePen is there to give students a chance to review the exercise and attempt it themselves before coming to class. We recommend encouraging students to get as far as they can until they get stuck and then reviewing the exercise and solution in class.

## Tiering
Basic Sorts is a **Tier 1** lesson. Students should understand how bubble sort and insertion sort work, and be able to implement them, before moving on to more complex algorithms. Bubble sort and insertion sort are the most basic algorithms that we cover in CS, so if students aren't understanding them, they may have trouble with more complex algorithms like merge sort and quick sort. Take the time to ensure that students can complete the exercises and have a good grasp on the concepts.

## Teaching Tips
* If students are having trouble with the exercises, focus them on solving the [bubble sort](https://git.generalassemb.ly/software-engineering-immersive/SEI-Course-Materials/blob/master/6_computer-science-materials/algorithms/basic-sorts/exercises/BubbleSort.js) exercise over the insertion sort exercise.
